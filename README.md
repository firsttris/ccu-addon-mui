# Motivation

Most Userinterfaces for Homematic are rather old and slow.
From a technical perspective many web based solutions are stuck with old commonJS code with callback hell of jquery and bootstraps. 

My goal is to use modern Frontend-Technology the create a simple but blazing fast responsive web ui which you can install as an Addon on your ccu3 Homematic.
